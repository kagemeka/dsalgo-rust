# cplib

## description

this package is a easy and portable collection of algorithms for competitive programming.
what's different from dsalgo?

- dsalgo
  - full and deep algorithms/data structures as encyclopedia.
  - well tested and documented.
  - clear naming
  - multiple implementation for each algorithm.
- cplib
  - poortable and can be bundled into a single submission file with small file size.
  - simple or no test
  - abbreviated naming
  - one implementation for each algorithm.

this package is not stable and might be separated from this project in the future.
