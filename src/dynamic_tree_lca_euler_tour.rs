// TODO: draft
// by using e.g. lazy segment tree, we can remove a node from tree, and answer
// for the lca query.
// if a node is removed, all the descendants' depth are reduced by 1
// -> range add range minimum query.
// also, by using dynamic binary search tree like (lazy?) splay tree,
// we might be able to add a node in addition to removing a node.
